Software architect and developer, speaker, PHP and web development expert, PHPSP and PHPWomen evangelist.

I believe that all knowledge should be shared and that's why I actively participate in the developer community, working on content such as workshops, classes, lectures, articles and contributing with open source.

I'm also vocalist of NoWay, Heavy Metal band with 2 released albums, and I dedicate myself to the study and practice of Kung Fu through Ving Tsun.

How can I help you? Send me an email or message me on social media :)
